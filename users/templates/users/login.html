    features:
    <ul>
        <li>Bookmarks can be tagged into categories!</li>
        <li>Those categories can also be tagged themselves. So if you have a category &quot;dogs&quot; you can tag it
        &quot;animals&quot; and anything tagged &quot;dogs&quot; will also be tagged &quot;animals&quot;!</li>
        <li>You can search your bookmarks and tags!</li>
        <li>No social media integration! No &quot;like&quot; buttons everywhere, no counters saying how popular websites
        are, nothing.</li>
    </ul>
